 WHAT IS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?
 
 AN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IS A WAY PROGRAMMING WHICH ENABLES PROGRAMMERS TO THINK LIKE THEY ARE WORKING WITH REAL-LIFE ENTITIES(A THING WITH DISTINCT AND 
 INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE) OR OBJECTS. iN REAL-LIFE, PEOPLE HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND CAN DO VARIOUS WORKS. iN oop, OBJECTS HAVE FIELDS TO STORE KNOWLEDGE/STATE/DATA AND 
 CAN DO VARIOUS WORKS â€” METHODS.

1. ABSTRACTION

ABSTRACTION IS A PROCESS OF HIDING THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FROM THE USER, ONLY THE FUNCTIONALITY WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE USER.IN OTHER WORDS,
THE USER WILL HAVE THE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE OBJECT DOES INSTEAD OF HOW IT DOES IT. BY HIDING COMPLEX STEPS/DETAILS/COMPUTATIONS/STATEMENTS INSIDE YOUR CLASSES
AND CREATING PUBLIC METHODS TO ACCESS THEM. EX: WRAPPER CLASSES
